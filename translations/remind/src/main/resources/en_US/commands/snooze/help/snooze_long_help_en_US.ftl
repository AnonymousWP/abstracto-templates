Re-creates a reminder with a new duration. This is only possible for reminders which already have been executed and were started by you.
The syntax for duration is the following:
s - seconds
m - minutes
h - hours
d - days

They must be positive and do no spaces between for example `1h23m` is one hour and twenty three minutes.
